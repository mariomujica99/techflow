> ### About This Repository
> This is the **production version** of Techflow, deployed for department use.
>
> A Task Management System (EEG orders, patient task checklists, procedure-level data) requires a formal HIPAA compliance review for deployment in a clinical environment.
> 
> Techflow intentionally excludes those features as a deliberate compliance decision. A separate repository preserves the full feature set for portfolio and demonstration purposes.

## Overview

**Techflow** is a full-stack Progressive Web App designed specifically for **EEG (Electroencephalography) Technologists** working in hospital neurophysiology departments. The system addresses real-world operational challenges by providing:

- Team coordination through an interactive digital whiteboard
- Equipment monitoring for an overview of issues with computer stations
- Inventory tracking for medical supplies across multiple storage locations
- Role-based access control separating admin and member responsibilities
- Multi-department architecture allowing each department to operate independently

This application was built to demonstrate my full-stack development skills including authentication, state management, file uploads, and responsive design.

**The Problems:**
- Manual Whiteboard: Staff must navigate through a chat to find the whiteboard picture of the day
- Communication Gaps: No centralized system for supply needs, leading to delays and out of stock supplies
- Information: Important images and reference materials not centralized
- Equipment Issues: Computer station problems aren't consistently documented or tracked

**Solution:** Techflow brings everything related to our department into one central, accessible location. It is as a digital command center for EEG operations.

### Multi-Department Support
Techflow is architected for **multi-department deployment**. Each department operates in a fully isolated environment. Data, users, whiteboards, supplies, and files are all scoped per department. No data crosses department boundaries.

**How it works:**
- Department administrators receive a unique **Department Invite Token** to share with their team
- All users who register with that token are automatically scoped to that department
- An optional **Admin Invite Token** grants elevated admin privileges within a department
- Each department has its own independent whiteboard, supply lists, computer stations, file storage, and user directory

This design allows multiple hospital departments to run Techflow simultaneously without any overlap in data or operations.

### **Authentication & Authorization**
- Secure JWT-based authentication with 14-day token expiration
- Role-based access control (Admin/User)
- Department and Admin invite token system for controlled registration
- Password hashing using bcrypt with salt rounds
- Profile customization with image uploads or color avatars
- Account management with secure deletion

### **Progressive Web App (PWA)**
- Installable on desktop and mobile devices
- Add to home screen functionality
- App-like experience with custom icons
- Safe area insets for notched devices

### **Database Schema Design**

**6 Core Collections:**
1. **Users** - Team members with authentication and department scoping
2. **Providers** - Reading physicians
3. **ComStations** - Equipment tracking
4. **Supplies** - Inventory by storage room
5. **Whiteboards** - Daily assignments with user/provider references
6. **Files** - Document hierarchy with folder support

**Key Relationships:**
- All resources scoped to `departmentId` for data isolation
- Whiteboards → Users (many-to-many via coverage arrays)
- Whiteboards → Providers (one-to-one via readingProviders)
- Files → Users (one-to-many via uploadedBy)
- Files → Files (self-referential for folder hierarchy)

---

## Frontend

### **State Management Strategy**
- **Context API** for global user authentication state
- **Local State** (useState) for component-specific data
- **Local Storage** for JWT token persistence

### **Routing Architecture**
- **Public Routes:** Login, Sign Up
- **Private Routes (Members):** Whiteboard, Supplies, Computer Stations, Files, Team Members, Providers, Edit Profile
- **Private Routes (Admins):** All member routes + Create/Delete operations, Reports
- **Role-based redirects** on login based on user role

### **Responsive Design Approach**
- **Mobile-First** Tailwind CSS classes
- **Breakpoints:** sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px), 2xl (1536px), 3xl (1920px)
- **Touch-Optimized** UI elements for mobile devices
- **Viewport Fit** for notched devices (iPhone X+)
- **Safe Area Insets** for PWA installation
